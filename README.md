Memory Game

This project is a memory game created in the front-end languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The reason that I made this project is that I waned to make a game simple enough to complete and do well but also a game complex enough where you can add lots of features and functionality. I want to create a game where you can race to see who can finish the flashcards in the shortest amount of time and rank yourselves among friends. 

The approach that I plan to take is to complete the HTML and CSS portion by giving it an outline and having it close to what I want, then start the functionality or backbone using JS. After it is working, I will add any final touch-ups that it needs. I don't plan on making a ton of animations or making it look extremely nice because I would rather focus on functionality and features over looks but I don't want to neglect how it looks.

Some unsolved problems I can think of would be making the cards and randomizing where they are could be a problem. The other potential problem I can think of would be making them flip and checking if the flipped cards are the same or not.

Features that I plan to add after the basic app is made are the following:
-Scoreboard to show the ranking
-The ability to choose how many lines and columns you want to increase or decrease difficulty
-Add the ability to change what is on each card / change theme.
